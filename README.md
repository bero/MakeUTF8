# MakeUTF8
A console tool that list and convert pas and inc-files to UTF8.
This was made for my needs but it is easy to change souce for other filetypes as well

What it can do
- List all files in a folder with subfolders that is only ANSI
- List all files in a folder with subfolders that is only UTF8
- Convert all files in a folder with subfolders that is ANSI to UTF8

  If no folder is given as parameter current directory is used
